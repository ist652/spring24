        "2. The line `C = np.ones((2, 3, 3))` creates a three-dimensional array filled with ones. The `np.ones()` function creates an array of the specified shape, where each element is initialized to 1. In this case, we pass the shape `(2, 3, 3)` to create a three-dimensional array with two dimensions of size 3x3.\n",

        "- `a.sum(axis=1)`: This code calculates the sum of elements along the rows of the array or matrix `a`.\n",

        "Structure:\n",
        "- `a`: represents the input array or matrix on which the sum operation is performed.\n",
        "- `.sum(axis=1)`: method called on the array `a` to calculate the sum along a specific axis. In this case, `axis=1` specifies that the sum should be calculated along the rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functionality:\n",
        "- The code calculates the sum of elements along the rows of the array or matrix `a`. Each row is treated as a separate entity, and the sum is calculated by adding up all the elements within each row.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works:\n",
        "- When `a.sum(axis=1)` is executed, it iterates over each row of the array `a` and calculates the sum of the elements in that row.\n",
        "- The result is returned as a new array or a single-dimensional array (depending on the shape of `a`) containing the sums of each row.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `axis=1` parameter allows flexibility to perform operations along different axes, such as calculating column-wise sums (`axis=0`) or even sums across higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "2. `axis=1`: The `axis` parameter specifies the axis along which the sum operation is performed. In this case, `axis=1` indicates that the sum is calculated along the second axis (columns) of the array `a`.\n",
        "3. `keepdims=True`: The `keepdims` parameter is set to `True`, which means the dimensions of the resulting array will be the same as the original array `a`. It preserves the shape of the array, including the dimensions that were summed over.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notable Features/Functionality:**\n",
        "- The `sum` method allows you to perform summation along a specific axis of a multi-dimensional array.\n",

        "In this example, we have a 2-dimensional array `a` with two rows and three columns. By calling `a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)`, we perform a sum operation along the second axis (columns), which gives us the sum of elements in each row. The resulting array `sum_result` preserves the shape with dimensions `(2, 1)`, where each row contains the sum of elements in the corresponding row of the original array `a`.\n",
