    "- DO NOT write the function until you get the code working. ALWAYS re-factor (rewrite) the WORKING code as a function.\n",
    "- One API call per function. Don't do too much!\n",
    "- Inputs into the API call such as query string parameters or `POST` body text should be function input parameters.\n",
    "- The function should NOT return the entire response unless its required. Only return what is needed.\n",
    "- use `response.raise_for_status()` to throw `HTTPError` exceptions. This way you will not be misled when there is a problem with the API and not your code.\n",
    "- DO NOT handle errors in your function or account for contingencies. Error handling is the responsilbity of the function's caller.\n",
