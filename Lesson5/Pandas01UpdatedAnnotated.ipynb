The `sort_values()` function is used here, and it takes two main parameters:\n","   - `['Name']`: This specifies the column(s) by which the DataFrame should be sorted. In this case, it's the 'Name' column.\n","   - `ascending=True`: This parameter determines whether the sorting should be done in ascending or descending order. Here, it's set to `True`, indicating ascending order.\n","\n","   The sorted DataFrame is assigned to a new variable called `Sorted`.\n","\n","2. `Sorted.head()`: This line of code displays the first few rows of the sorted DataFrame `Sorted`. By default, the `head()` function displays the first 5 rows. If you want to specify a different number of rows, you can pass an integer value within the parentheses (e.g., `head(10)` to display the first 10 rows).\n","\n","Use cases for this code could include scenarios where you need to sort a DataFrame based on a specific column, such as sorting a list of students by their names, sorting a list of products by their prices, or sorting a list of cities by their populations.

The result of this operation is stored in a variable called `gender`, which represents a groupby object.\n","\n","The groupby operation in pandas is used to split a DataFrame into groups based on a specified column or set of columns. In this case, the 'Gender' column is used as the criterion for grouping.\n","\n","The `groupby()` function creates a groupby object, which is an intermediate data structure that allows for further analysis and operations on the grouped data. It  enables various operations on grouped data, such as aggregation, transformation, and filtering. Once we have the groupby object, we can apply these operations to each group or to the entire grouped data.\n","\n","Here are a few examples of how the `gender` groupby object can be used:\n","\n","1. Aggregation: We can calculate summary statistics for each group separately. For instance, we can compute the average age of males and females in the DataFrame by applying the `mean()` function to the `gender` groupby object:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   gender['Age'].mean()\n","   ```\n","\n","   This will return the average age for each gender group.\n","\n","2. Transformation: We can perform operations on each group independently and return a new DataFrame with the transformed data. For example, we can normalize the 'Salary' column within each gender group by subtracting the mean salary of the group from each value:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   normalized_salary = gender['Salary'].transform(lambda x: x - x.mean())\n","   ```\n","\n","   The `transform()` function applies the specified transformation function (in this case, a lambda function) to each group separately and returns a new Series with the transformed values.\n","\n","3. Filtering: We can filter the data based on some condition within each group. For instance, we can select only the rows where the 'Education' column is 'Bachelor's degree' within each gender group:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   filtered_data = gender.apply(lambda x: x[x['Education'] == \"Bachelor's degree\"])\n","   ```\n","\n","   The `apply()` function applies the specified function (in this case, a lambda function) to each group and returns a new DataFrame
